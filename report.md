# **Remote Server Tutorial**

For CSE 15L, connecting to the remote server is one basic skill that you will need to learn. Good thing there's a perfectly good tutorial right here for you to use!
In this tutorial, I'll go through the three steps that I used to connect my course account on ieng6: 
  - Installing VSCode
  - Remotely Connecting
  - Using Commands

## **Installing VSCode**

If you don't already have the code editor VSCode, you'll have to get it. Not only will it be useful in this course, many professionals use it in their workflow. 
However, I didn't download VSCode because I already had it on my computer. If you don't already have VSCode, you can download it at this link: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Once you download and install it, the home page should look something like this: ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/aI2eUO8.png)

## **Remotely Connecting**

After installing VSCode, you're going to have to install [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/). I downloaded Git for Windows and installed it. After, I opened Git Bash in VSCode. To do it, I: 
  - Opened the terminal with *CTRL* + *\`* 
  - Opened the command palette with *CTRL* + *SHIFT* + *P* 
  - Typed "Select Default Profile" 
  - Selected the Git Bash option, and finally
  - Clicked the *+* icon in the terminal

You should now see a Git Bash terminal.
