# **Remote Server Tutorial**

For CSE 15L, connecting to the remote server is one basic skill that you will need to learn. Good thing there's a perfectly good tutorial right here for you to use!
In this tutorial, I'll go through the three steps that I used to connect my course account on ieng6: 
  - Installing VSCode
  - Remotely Connecting
  - Using Commands

## **Installing VSCode**

If you don't already have the code editor VSCode, you'll have to get it. Not only will it be useful in this course, many professionals use it in their workflow. 
However, I didn't download VSCode because I already had it on my computer. If you don't already have VSCode, you can download it at this link: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Once you download and install it, the home page should look something like this: ![Image](https://github.com/vlmontegrande/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/8176768e55020f2500e19ef83e25a096893abcc8/images/Screenshot%20(10).png)

## **Remotely Connecting**

After installing VSCode, you're going to have to install [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/). I downloaded Git for Windows and installed it. After, I opened Git Bash in VSCode. To do it, I: 
  - Opened the terminal with *CTRL* + *\`* 
  - Opened the command palette with *CTRL* + *SHIFT* + *P* 
  - Typed "Select Default Profile" 
  - Selected the Git Bash option, and finally
  - Clicked the *+* icon in the terminal

The Git Bash terminal looks something like this: ![image](https://github.com/vlmontegrande/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/8176768e55020f2500e19ef83e25a096893abcc8/images/Screenshot%20(13).png)

To connect to the remote server, type "ssh cs15lsp23??@ieng6.ucsd.edu" with ?? replaced by the letters of your course account.
If you get a message about the authenticity of the host, type yes. When it prompts you for your password, type your password (keep in mind that when you type your password, you can't see what is being written). After all of that, you should be connected to the server. It should look something like this:

Congratulations! You have connected to the remote server. Now it's time to get comfortable with commands.

## **Using Commands**

Now is the time to try some commands! Using commands like cd, ls, pwd, and mkdir, you can do some interesting things in the terminal! 
I especially like moving around the file directory and exploring what's in where. I also made new directories and removed them. Here's what it looked like:
